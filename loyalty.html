    <section class="lyrics">
        <p>I said I'm geeked and I’m fired up (fired, fire)<br>
            All I want tonight is just get high (high, high, high)<br>
            Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)<br>
            Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)<br>
            <br>

            It’s a secret society<br>
            All we ask is trust (all we ask is trust)<br>
            All we got is us<br>
            Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br>
            Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br>
            <br>

            Kung Fu Kenny now<br>
            My resume is real enough for two millenniums<br>
            A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them<br>
            I meditate and moderate all of my wins again<br>
            I'm hangin' on the fence again<br>
            I'm always on your mind<br>
            I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line<br>
            And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind<br>
            You rollin' with it at the right time, right now<br>
            (Only for the dollar sign)<br>
            <br>

            Bad girl RiRi now<br>
            Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now<br>
            On your pulse like it's EDM<br>
            Gas in the bitch like it’s premium<br>
            Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane<br>
            Been a bad bitch way before any cash came<br>
            I’m established, hundred carats on my name<br>
            Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I’m alright<br>
            <br>

            I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I'm a king<br>
            Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (yeah)<br>
            You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)<br>
            You can babysit him when I leave him outside<br>
            Ain’t no other love like the one I know<br>
            I done been down so long lost hope<br>
            I done came down so hard I slowed<br>
            Honestly forever, all a real nigga want<br>
            <br>

            I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)<br>
            All I want tonight is just to get high up (yeah)<br>
            All I want is, all I want is<br>

            <br>
            Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br>
            Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br>
            10-4, no switchin' sides<br>
            Feel somethin' wrong<br>
            You actin' shifty, you don't ride<br>
            With me no more, I need<br>
            Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br>
            Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br>

            <br>
            Tell me who you loyal to<br>
            Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?<br>
            Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?<br>
            Big chillin', only for the power in your name<br>
            Tell me who you loyal to<br>
            Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?<br>
            Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?<br>
            Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart<br>

            <br>
            Tell me who you loyal to<br>
            Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)<br>
            Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)<br>
            How you loyal to yourself in advance?<br>
            I said, tell me who you loyal to<br>
            Is it anybody that you would lie for?<br>
            Anybody you would slide for?<br>
            Anybody you would die for?<br>
            That's what God for<br>

            <br>
            I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)<br>
            All I want tonight is just to get high up (yeah)<br>
            All I want is, all I want is<br>

            <br>
            Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br>
            Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br>
            10-4, no switchin' sides<br>
            Feel somethin' wrong<br>
            You actin' shifty, you don't ride<br>
            With me no more, I need<br>
            Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br>
            Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br>

            <br>
            It's so hard to be humble<br>
            It's so hard to be<br>
            Lord knows I'm tryin'<br>
            Lord knows I'm dyin', baby<br>
