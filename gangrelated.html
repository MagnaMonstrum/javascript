        <br>
        Yeah, livin' life like this<br>
        Gotta paint a picture when I write like this<br>
        Tales from my hood, not a sight like this<br>
        Where they up to no good on a night like this<br>
        And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause<br>
        Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was<br>
        I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug<br>
        Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug<br>
        Now, born and raised in my area<br>
        Beautiful by day, by night it's hysteria<br>
        Fuck around and bury ya tonight<br>
        Ridin' with my homies on sight<br>
        Momma tell me to come in at night<br>
        Now I really gotta go, but they never know<br>
        Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow<br>
        Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib<br>
        In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib<br>
        Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night<br>
        Wakin' up, scared for my life<br>
        Never had the heat, just a knife<br>
        When the gat go blat like that<br>
        Guarantee you it’s a wrap<br>
        Finna put you on your back like that<br>
        Just breathe, while their mama grieve<br>
        Bullet to the dome like an Aleve<br>
        Gotta leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis<br>
        No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop<br>
        ‘Fore they even call the cops<br>
        Do it for the money and the bitches<br>
        And the drugs and the props<br>
        Tell me why another body even gotta drop<br>
        Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related<br>
        <br>


        Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg, where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. <br>
        It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. <br>
        Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight<br>
        <br>

        Livin' life like this<br>
        Hope little Bobby never fight like this<br>
        Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this<br>
        All about the money on a night like this<br>
        Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib<br>
        Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance<br>
        Never had the chance, yeah<br>
        Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out<br>
        If you want it I'ma lay it out<br>
        Hope my little brother make it out<br>
        Every night what I pray about what I pray about<br>
        Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way<br>
        But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away<br>
        I imagine a better life<br>
        Where I never had a debt in life<br>
        Hit you with the {gunshots} in the dead of night<br>
        Sellin' crack to my own pops<br>
        Pushin' this weight on my own block<br>
        If I sell a brick I can buy a house<br>
        If they find the key they might lock me up<br>
        But I take the chance<br>
        'Cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck<br>
        Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck<br>
        [Pause] — Get down or lay down<br>
        Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down<br>
        Stray shots on the playground<br>
        Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given<br>
        Anybody that’s ridin' with me, I’m ridin' with 'em<br>
        Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em<br>
        The second I bit 'em, I get 'em<br>
        And hit 'em with the venom<br>
        Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it<br>
        I knew it, already been through it<br>
        I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life<br>
        Anybody that's gang related<br>
