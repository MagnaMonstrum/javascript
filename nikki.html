            <br>
            I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins<br>
            Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain<br>
            I tried some others but man they just not as good as you<br>
            Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you<br>
            Maybe I’m just not as strong as I once was<br>
            When we’re together lately I don’t even feel a buzz<br>
            I’m addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs<br>
            Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go<br>
            Cause in the end what happens you already know<br>
            Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low<br>
            But in my mind I’m wondering what I’m paying for<br>
            All these other bitches on my dick but I can’t fuck with that<br>
            You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back<br>
            Even though you turn my lungs black<br>
            Tell me where you been Jack<br>
            Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary<br>
            I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing<br>
            Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy<br>
            But when I ended things with her it was just you and me<br>
            Doing me good, that’s what I thought at first<br>
            Me and you together, swear to God that’s all that worked<br>
            Away from you though man it's just so hard to work<br>
            Uh, my heart is hard at work<br>
            We been together like ten years<br>
            Goddamn, took me as young man<br>
            Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go<br>
            What will they write upon my grave?<br>
            A free man born as a king, who died as a slave<br>
            But everything he gave her was for nothing though<br>
            Oh no I can’t fade that shit I gotta let you go<br>
            You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas<br>
            All this shit you got me doing man it’s outrageous<br>
            All I know is I’m living the life I never would<br>
            Finally let you go, I thought I never could<br>
            Don’t get me wrong, can’t forget the times shared<br>
            Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there<br>
            Tried to run but my legs won’t<br>
            I look away but my head don’t<br>
            I love it when you’re fresh<br>
            I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath<br>
            <br>
            I hate it that I need you, Nikki<br>
            But I love it when I feed you, Nikki<br>
            I hate that I bleed for you<br>
            Uh, I long and I need for you<br>
            But I love it when I taste you<br>
            Nothing can replace you<br>
            I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go<br>
            But you’re everywhere I long to be<br>
            And all these other people that don’t seem to understand<br>
            I’m just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me<br>
            Man you’re everything I crave<br>
            You’re the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave<br>
            I’m a king, you’re my Coretta<br>
            But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine<br>
            <br>

            Slave for the—<br>
            Said, I’m a slave for the nicotine<br>
            Been a slave for ya<br>
            I’m a muthafuckin' slave for ya<br>
            Slave for the nicotine<br>
            Nikki, Nikki, slave for ya<br>
            I’m a slave for ya Nikki<br>
            I’m a muthafuckin' slave for ya<br>
