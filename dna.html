        <p><br>
            I got, I got, I got, I got—<br>
            Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA<br>
            Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA<br>
            I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA<br>
            I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA<br>
            I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception<br>
            I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon<br>
            I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head<br>
            This that put-the-kids-to-bed<br>
            This that I got, I got, I got, I got—<br>
            Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA<br>
            I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA<br>
            I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA<br>
            I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA<br>
            I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve<br>
            Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird<br>
            You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard<br>
            I know how you work, I know just who you are<br>
            See, you's a, you's a, you's a—<br>
            Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA<br>
            Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA<br>
            Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA<br>
            Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge<br>
            See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front<br>
            Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son<br>
            I know murder, conviction<br>
            Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption<br>
            Scholars, fathers dead with kids and<br>
            I wish I was fed forgiveness<br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (soldier’s DNA)<br>
            Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade<br>
            When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay<br>
            At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate<br>
            And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial extrovert<br>
            And excellent mean the extra work<br>
            And absentness what the fuck you heard<br>
            And pessimists never struck my nerve<br>
            And that’s a riff, gon' plead his case<br>
            The reason my power's here on earth<br>
            Salute the truth, when the prophet say<br>
            <br>

            I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA<br>
            This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years<br>
            I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA<br>
            I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life<br>
            I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA<br>
            I live a be-, fuck your life<br>
            5, 4, 3, 2, 1<br>
            This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'<br>
            Money and power, the maker of marriages<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Tell me somethin'<br>
            You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'<br>
            I'd rather die than to listen to you<br>
            My DNA not for imitation<br>
            Your DNA an abomination<br>
            This how it is when you in the Matrix<br>
            Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow<br>
            And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go<br>
            And sleepin' in a villa<br>
            Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'<br>
            Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors<br>
            Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window<br>
            Baby in the pool, godfather goals<br>
            Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer<br>
            Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras<br>
            Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals<br>
            Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana<br>
            Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes<br>
            Phone never on, I don't conversate<br>
            I don't compromise, I just penetrate<br>
            Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks<br>
            These are the times, level number 9<br>
            Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way<br>
            Sentence on the way, killings on the way<br>
            Motherfucker, I got winners on the way<br>
            You ain't shit without a body on your belt<br>
            You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate<br>
            You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself<br>
            You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate<br>
            Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate<br>
            Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith<br>
            Peace to the world, let it rotate<br>
            Sex, money, murder—our DNA<br>
