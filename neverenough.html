            When that liquor get po’ up<br>
            And that green get roll up<br>
            When them sets get throwed up<br>
            I’m like nah man, hol’ up<br>
            Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff<br>
            Better hope they don’t call my bluff<br>
            Cause my mind is going crazy<br>
            This shit is never enough<br>
            <br>



            When that liquor get po’ up<br>
            And that green get roll up<br>
            When them sets get throwed up<br>
            I’m like nah man, hol’ up<br>
            Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff<br>
            Better hope they don’t call my bluff<br>
            Cause my mind is going crazy<br>
            This shit is never enough<br>
            <br>


            Never enough, never enough, never enough<br>
            This shit is never enough<br>
            <br>


            <br>
            Never enough, never enough, never enough<br>
            This shit is never enough<br>

            <br>


            Not even, not even, not even, not enough<br>
            Not even, not even, not even, not enough<br>
            Not even, not even, not even, not enough<br>
            Not even, not even, not even, not enough<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit<br>
            At the party with my homies, walk up and they play my shit<br>
            On the road, kick a song, didn’t have to sell my soul<br>
            Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal<br>
            Where you stay, every day, just got my crib in LA<br>
            Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ<br>
            Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh<br>
            Bitches on my dick, don’t give a fuck, y’all must not know what’s up<br>
            In the cut, we don’t give a fuck, we just trying to cut<br>
            Line em up, if they say they bout it then we’ll sign em up<br>
            Rattpack, that’s a fact, basic bitch can’t fuck with that<br>
            Where you at? That’s what they be asking, I say on the map<br>
            <br>


            <br>
            Who we are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet<br>
            Drop that new shit just cause they demand it<br>
            Living like we got it cause we get it<br>
            Do it just to say we fucking did it<br>
            <br>
            [Bridge]<br>
            Who we are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet<br>
            Drop that new shit just cause they demand it<br>
            Living like we got it cause we get it<br>
            Do it just to say we fucking did it<br>
            <br>

            When that liquor get po’ up<br>
            And that green get roll up<br>
            When them sets get throwed up<br>
            I’m like nah man, hol’ up<br>
            Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff<br>
            Better hope they don’t call my bluff<br>
            Cause my mind is going crazy<br>
            This shit is never enough<br>
            <br>


            Never enough, never enough, never enough<br>
            This shit is never enough<br>
            <br>


            <br>
            Not even, not even, not even, not enough<br>
