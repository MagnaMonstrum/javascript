        <p>New Kung Fu Kenny<br>
            Ain't nobody prayin' for me<br>
            Y'all know, what happens on Earth stays on Earth<br>
            Here we go!<br>
            I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck<br>
            I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck<br>
            <br>

            I'm willin' to die for this shit<br>
            I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit<br>
            Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit<br>
            D-O-T my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy<br>
            I been stomped out in front of my momma<br>
            My daddy commissary made it to commas<br>
            Bitch, all my grandmas dead<br>
            So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy<br>
            Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'<br>
            Auntie on my Telegram like, "Be cautious!"<br>
            I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton<br>
            I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton<br>
            I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga<br>
            I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga<br>
            We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope<br>
            That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know
            <br>

            If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy<br>
            If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy<br>
            I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy<br>
            They won't take me out my element<br>
            Nah, take me out my element<br>
            <br>

            I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy<br>
            An imaginary rich nigga, ayy<br>
            Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy<br>
            Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy<br>
            Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy<br>
            We okay, we let the A1 fly<br>
            Relocate, jump on the same G5<br>
            Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go yeah, I go yeah<br>
            They never been ready, yeah, I know yeah, know yeah<br>
            100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah<br>
            None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah<br>
            Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it<br>
            I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races<br>
            You know this'll never be a tie, just look at their laces<br>
            You know careers take off, just gotta be patient<br>
            Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic<br>
            Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option<br>
            <br>

            If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy<br>
            If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy<br>
            I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy<br>
            They won't take me out my element<br>
            Nah, take me out my element<br>
            <br>

            Damned if I do, if I don't (yuh)<br>
            Goddamn us all if you won't (yuh)<br>
            Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame<br>
            You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way<br>
            <br>

            Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?<br>
            Niggas thought that K-Dot real life<br>
            Was the same life they see on TV, huh?<br>
            Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?<br>
            Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?<br>
            'Cause most of y'all ain't real<br>
            Most of y'all gon' squeal<br>
            Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed<br>
            Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand<br>
            Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman<br>
            Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies<br>
            Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised<br>
            Last LP I tried to lift the black artists<br>
            But it's a difference between black artists and wack artists<br>
            <br>


            If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy<br>
            It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri<br>
            If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy<br>
            I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy<br>
            They won't take me out my element<br>
            Nah, take me out my element<br>
