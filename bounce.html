        <p>
            <br>
            Living good, I've been living good<br>
            Rolling through my hood, understood<br>
            Just a youngin in this bitch up to no good<br>
            In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me<br>
            Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties<br>
            Out the blue, like a Crip<br>
            But I never bang, no, they know<br>
            We've been at it way before the fame, ho<br>
            (Way before the fame)<br>
            We've been at it way before the fame, ho<br>
            (Way before the...)<br>
            We've been at it way before the fame, psyche<br>
            Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it<br>
            I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch<br>
            Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit<br>
            No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this<br>
            Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do<br>
            Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue<br>
            I'm coming through<br>
            If I see your bitch I bet she coming too, what it do<br>
            We ain't never switch it up, we keep it true<br>
            <br>

            Out the blue, like a Crip<br>
            But I never bang though<br>
            They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho<br>
            Way before the fame, ho<br>
            At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)<br>
            Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)<br>
            Way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
            Way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
            Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
            Way before the fame, at it way before the fame<br>
            We've been at it way before the fame<br>
            (Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)<br>
            (Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)<br>

            <br>
            Back again, like I never left<br>
            Had to take a breath<br>
            Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore<br>
            God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam<br>
            They know who I am<br>
            Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce<br>
            Fuck it, make it count<br>
            With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa<br>
            Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla<br>
            It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross<br>
            Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world<br>
            Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl<br>
            RattPack, know the deal<br>
            What's the motto? Keep it real!<br>
            (I know) I got it, I want it, I need it<br>
            We live in an era where they get deleted<br>
            I'm wondering if I'ma make it<br>
            Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it<br>
            These bitches they love it, but I never covet<br>
            I just keep it going that's why I be flowing<br>
            I'm already knowing this life that I'm living<br>
            Don't know what I'm given<br>
            It's so hard not to give in<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Out the blue, like a Crip<br>
            But I never bang though<br>
            They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho<br>
            Way before the fame, ho<br>
            At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)<br>
            Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)<br>
            Way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
            Way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
            Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
            Way before the fame, at it way before the fame<br>
            We've been at it way before the fame<br>
            (Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)<br>
            (Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)<br>
